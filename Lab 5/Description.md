## Association, Composition and Aggregation in C++

**Association** is a relationship between two classes that defines a connection or a link between them.

Association in C++ is a relationship between two classes where one class uses the functionalities provided by the other class. In other words, an association represents the connection or link between two classes. In an association, one class instance is connected to one or more instances of another class.

**Composition** is a relationship where one class is composed of one or more instances of the other class, and the composed class is an essential part of the composite class. 

it is a relationship between two classes in which one class, known as the composite class, contains an object of another class, known as the component class, as a member variable. The composite class owns the component class, and the component class cannot exist independently of the composite class. In other words, the lifetime of the component class is controlled by the composite class.

**Aggregation** is a relationship where one class is composed of one or more instances of the other class, and the composed class is not an essential part of the composite class.

it is a relationship between two classes in which one class, known as the aggregate class, contains a pointer or reference to an object of another class, known as the component class. The component class can exist independently of the aggregate class, and it can be shared by multiple aggregate classes. In other words, the lifetime of the component class is not controlled by the aggregate class.
